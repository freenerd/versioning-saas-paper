\begin{abstract}
In this report we present our findings of how to provide different versions of a SaaS to multiple tenants at the same time. We present a categorization of versioning approaches based on the layer of the SaaS application stack they are implemented in. We then evaluate them against our own experiences in developing SaaS applications.
