Version-aware databases

Switching versions per user. We assumed for our architecture that a tenant chooses the version for all their users at the same time \ref{sec:architecture}. Future research should investigate how versioning on the user-level could be implemented.

One technique to build SaaS that serve many users is to use caching. We have omitted caching in this report but think it should be investigated.
