To introduce the reader to the topic of Software as a Service the lecture of~\cite{Chong2006a} is strongly advised as it discusses the underlying business model and proposes attributes to classify SaaS.

An argument for the need to run multiple versions of a SaaS due to legislative reasons is made in \cite{Bezemer2010}.
Further on the authors of \cite{Bezemer2010} discuss that for a multi-tenant architecture the software itself has to be written version-aware.
This in turn increases the code complexity, compared to the possibility of creating a new instance of the application for each version in a multi-instance architecture.

Though theoretically explored already in \cite{roddick1995survey} our research did not yield any database management system supporting schema versioning to that degree, that client applications could actually operate on different versions of a schema simultanously.
Whereas schema evolution has been already repeatedly implemented in the application layer \cite{Weissman2009} \cite{Keddo}.
There is only one publication by \cite{Aulbach2011} which describes a schema versioning scheme accompanied by the evaluation of a prototypical implementation for a main-memory DBMS. Their approach is motivated by the idea that schema handling should be responsibility of the database layer instead of the application layer.
