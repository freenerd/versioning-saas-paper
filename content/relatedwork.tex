As introduction to the topic of Software as a Service, reading the paper~\cite{Chong2006a} is advised as it discusses the underlying business model and proposes attributes to classify SaaS.

An argument for the need to run multiple versions of a SaaS due to legislative reasons is made in~\cite{Bezemer2010}. The authors also discuss that for a multi-tenant architecture the software itself has to be written version-aware in order to support customizing. This in turn increases the code complexity, compared to the possibility of creating a new instance of the application for each version in a multi-instance architecture.

The topic of schema versioning has been discussed by~\cite{roddick1995survey}. Schema evolution has also been implemented in the application layer in~\cite{Weissman2009}~\cite{Keddo}.

A schema versioning scheme has been implemented prototypically in a main-memory database management system by~\cite{Aulbach2011}. Their approach is motivated by the idea that schema handling should be the responsibility of the database layer instead of the application layer.
