\section{Conclusion}

Versioning is mainly a concern of one layer in architecture

Where to select the version?
multi-instance: access layer
1:1 = routing layer
1:n = code level

High Level Versioning:
clean separation of versioning concern
low consolidation

Low Level Versioning:
versioning inside of application
high consolidation

Versioning is mainly an engineering problem
key aspect: migrating schema \& data
Version-aware databases should support this

General question: Do you want to version in the traditional way of packing a lot of features into one release? This was born out of necessity to actually ship a physical product. With SaaS shipping software became instentaneuous, thus no need to bundle features into one big release other than for communication and marketing. It is much easier to ship based on features. We believe these advantages should be used, which leads to a more fine-grained versioning with a faster iteration time.
