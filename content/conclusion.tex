Versioning is mainly a concern of one layer in architecture

Where to select the version?
multi-instance: access layer
1:1 = routing layer
1:n = code level

High Level Versioning:
clean separation of versioning concern
low consolidation

Low Level Versioning:
versioning inside of application
high consolidation

Versioning is mainly an engineering problem
key aspect: migrating schema & data
Version-aware databases should support this
