\subsection{Multi-Instance}

Not multi-tenant in itself, but usually the most inuitive way to provide saas. good if not too many clients.

though this seems simple from an architectual perspective
bad consolidation factor
high maintenance cost as operation complexity increases with the number of tenants
not the spirit of SaaS
