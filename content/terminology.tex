Terminology

SaaS
What is multi tenancy? How does it relate to multi user?
  multi-user is a subset of multi-tenant
  every tenant is a multi-user system in itself
  Multi-tenant =  Multi-User + SLA + Heavily customizable [DELFT]
Code-Revision / Product-Version
  - explain PV stop talking about CR afterwards
  - // api versioning is just small fraction of the application
  Product version Visible to the user
  Code revision   Invisible to the user

  Coupling of product version and code revision depends on architecture of application.
  example for "old" product version: use a specific software not just version 1 2 3 4 5
  MS office versions

  why only product version?
  if changes don't affect the user then we don't need to version
  When we mention 'version', we are talking about product versions.


(Frontend:UI/Backend:Busisness Logix/DB)
  - // how can we provide a versioning for all these layers with minimal cost. where the tenant can choose.
  - // how can we make sure that everything is in sync and consistent
  - granularity of versioning depends on how tight stack is coupled
  - users interface with versioning in frontend (tenant or even user specific)
  - backend/db is only versioned forward for whole tenant
  - stick with product version instead of code revision
- Configuration
  - variables in database in shared table layout
- Customization (int.)
  - code / templating executed in the context of the saas provider
  - huge changes
  - // Eyad does not care about config/customization
  - // predefined columns
  - // Eyad doesn't care
  - -> we handle just like configuration
  Customization (internal)
  Tenant-specific changes that run within the application context
  Examples:
  Templates, Custom DB fields, DSLs

- Extension (ext.)
  - // E column extension
  - not focused on marketplace
  - // truly external extensions are 2 much
  - // Eyad doesn't care, we don't do
  - -> we don't care
  Extension (external)
  Tenant-specific changes that run outside the application and interface with it over an API
  Example:
  Third-party add-ons in a marketplace
  addon is in a way just a regular customer as it is truly external
  we only have to consider customization in our architecture
