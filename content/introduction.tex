Reasons for versioning
  Manage incompatibility
    Feature change (User acceptance)
    API compatibility (Technical incompatibility)

  Rollout of features
    Ops: Does it scale?
    Biz/Users: Is it accepted by users? Does the feature 'work' (A/B testing)
  - Legal

  + provider pov
  needs flexibility to react to changed requirements
  reduce technical debt by retiring code/functionality
