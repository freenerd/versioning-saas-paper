@misc{Chong2006,
annote = {SaaS is distinguished by three qualities:
- scalability
- configurability
- multi-tenant efficiency
        
security pattern primitives:
- fitering in an intermediate layer btw tenant \& data source
- permissions a la ACL
- encryption
        
security patterns
- "impersonation" app users are mirrored in database access rights
- "trusted subsystem" each app-server has a different database account
- "combination" tenants are mirrored in database access rights, app-server authenticates users and uses corresponding tenant account
- "secure database tables" use database access rights to grant access to a whole table
- "tenant view filter" use views to grant access to a subset of a table's rows
- "tenant data encryption" asymmetric/symmetric-hybrid encryption to encrypt colums
   (!encryption vs. search)
        
extensibility patterns
- "preallocated fields" store everything in k-string-columns, each tenant may specify their own mapping (column label / data type) but these are implemented at app-level
- "name-value pairs" via extension table
- "custom columns" alter table definition directly for each tenant
        
scalability patterns
- "scale up" fatter boxes aka. better hardware
- "scale out" more boxes aka. partininiong databases onto multiple boxes
- "replication" MS easiert then MM
- "horizontal partinioning" split up the rows across multiple databases
- "vertitcal partitioning" split up the columns across multiple tables
- "tenant based horizontal paritioning" split your tenants evenly across multiple databases
- "single tenant scaleout" when you devote private servers to a tenant
